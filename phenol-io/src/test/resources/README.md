The `hp.module.json` contains Human Phenotype Ontology module in Obographs format. For the *Phenotypic abnormality*
subhierarchy, the module contains *Arachnodactyly* (`HP:0001166`) and the ancestors. The module contains all other HPO
subhierarchies.
The ontology contains 2 obsolete/deprecated terms:
- *obsolete Accessory middle-finger phalanges* (`HP:0004157`), and
- *obsolete Aplasia of the phalanges of the 3rd finger* (`HP:0009448`)

The obsolete terms have been fixed to designate *Abnormality of finger* (`HP:0001167`) as the primary term.
