/**
  Algorithms for operating on graphs.

  <p>The most important class of algorithms for ontologies are based on graph traversal. Thus, you
  will find the usual, common such algorithms in this module. The central concept here is the
  <b>visitor pattern</b>, codified by the {@link
 * org.monarchinitiative.phenol.graph.algo.VertexVisitor} interface.
