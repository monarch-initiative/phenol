# Phenol: Ontology Library for Phenomics and Genomics

A Java library for working with JSON phenotype ontologies including especially
the [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org) and the
[Mammalian Phenotype Ontology](http://www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/mp_ontology) and
associate phenotype annotation files.


## In Brief

- **Language/Platform:** Java >=11
- **License:** BSD 3-Clause Clear

- **Availability:**
    - `phenol-core` for dealing with (biological) ontologies.
    - `phenol-io` for reading ontologies from JSON files.
    - `phenol-annotations` for reading computational disease models of the HPO project
    - `phenol-analysis` several demo apps showing how to use phenol.
    - `phenol-cli` for performing empirical score distribution computation as a stand-alone program.

## Usage
We recommend importing the `phenol` modules that are needed for your application.

For instance:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.monarchinitiative.phenol</groupId>
    <artifactId>phenol-core</artifactId>
    <version>${phenol.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.monarchinitiative.phenol</groupId>
  <artifactId>phenol-io</artifactId>
<version>${phenol.version}</version>
</dependency>
<!-- ... and other modules -->
```

where `${phenol.version}` corresponds to the desired version, such as `2.1.0`.

## History
Phenol was initially forked from [ontolib]([https://github.com/Phenomics/ontolib) in February 2018, but was
extensively refactored and extended. The API of phenol and ontolib are not compatible with each other.
