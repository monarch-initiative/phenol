  uPheno--specific implementations of {@link org.monarchinitiative.phenol.ontology.data.Ontology} and
  related classes.

  <p>
  uPheno is a cross-species ontology integrating the HPO (human phenotype ontology), MPO (mammalian
  phenotype ontology) as well as the ZPO (zebrafish phenotype ontology).

  <p>
  The classes from this package facilitate working with uPheno by specialized types with attributes
  relevant when working with the uPheno, the relevant annotation formats as well as code with
  utilities and helpers.
